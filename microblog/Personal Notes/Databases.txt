Flask-SQLAlchemy
- Flask friendly wrapper for SQL Alchemy

SQL Alchemy
- Object Relational Mapper: uses class / objects / methods instead of tables & SQL
- Translate high level operations into db commants
- ORM for multiple relational DBs (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)

Flask-Migrate
- Flask wrapper for Alembic (db migration for SQL Alchemy)

1) Create a migration repository
- flask db init

2) Automatically generate migration script
- flask db migrate -m "first migration"

3) Apply changes to database
- flask db upgrade
    - Because this application uses SQLite, the upgrade command will detect that a database does not exist and will create it
        - app.db (SQLite database) is added after this command finishes
    - When working with database servers such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, you have to create the database in the database server before running upgrade.
    - User -> user
    - AddressAndPhone -> address_and_phone

Changes to db
- u = User(...)
- db.session.add(u)
- db.session.delete(u)
- db.session.commit()

Querying from db
- users = User.query.all()
- u = User.query.get(1)
